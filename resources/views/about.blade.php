<h1>What is A Link to the Past: VT Randomizer?</h1>
<div class="well">
	<p>The basic idea is that all item locations in the game have their items shuffled around… so for example you
		never know what you’re going to find when you open a treasure chest! There are many item locations in the
		game beyond treasure chests, for example overworld heart pieces and NPC’s that give you items
		- these are all included too!</p>
	<p>The VT Randomizer is a web based rom patcher that will allow you to make a randomized rom from one you
		supply. It is meant to always have the newest things available as the Randomizer team develops them.</p>
	<p>This was written and is maintained by Veetorp. A big thanks to Dessyreqt, ChristosOwen, Smallhacker and Karkat
		for their work - without which none of this would have been even remotely possible!</p>
</div>
<h1>Where do I download this?</h1>
<div class="well">
	<p>The VT Randomizer is an entirely web based randomizer, There is no download client for it. That being said
		the ROM is patched entirely in your browser. Being a web version we can get the newest features availble
		to users as quickly as possible. Click on <em>Generate Randomized Game</em> above to get started.</p>
	<p>There is a downloadable client version of the Randomizer (currently on v7) maintained by Dessyreqt which can be found here:
		<a href="https://dessyreqt.github.io/alttprandomizer/" target="_blank">https://dessyreqt.github.io/alttprandomizer/</a>
	</p>
	<p>Many features being tested in VT will land in the client version in the future.</p>
